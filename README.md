# Retro-Phone-Revival-Project

All around the world, there are still countless retro phones quietly existing.
They come in all kinds of shapes.
They last for days on a single charge.
They offer a pure, distraction-free, offline experience — far away from social media overload.

But sadly, almost no one is building new apps for them anymore.

That's why I started this project. 
I'm trying to build small, modern apps for these old devices with the help of modern tools like large language models.
Using Java ME — the most widely supported platform across feature phones from 2005 to 2010 — these apps can run on a wide range of classic models: from Nokia's S40 and S60 series, to Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung, and many others.
I hope this project can make it a little easier for people who still love old phones to keep using them — and maybe, keep them alive a little longer.
