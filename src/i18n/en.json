    "title": "About - Retro Phone Revival Project",
    "intro1": "All around the world, there are still countless retro phones quietly existing.",
    "intro2": "They come in all kinds of shapes.",
    "intro3": "They last for days on a single charge.",
    "intro4": "They offer a pure, distraction-free, offline experience — far away from social media overload.",
    "intro5": "But sadly, almost no one is building new apps for them anymore.",
    "statement": "That's why I started this project.",
    "description1": "I'm trying to build small, modern apps for these old devices with the help of modern tools like large language models.",
    "description2": "Using Java ME — the most widely supported platform across feature phones from 2005 to 2010 — these apps can run on a wide range of classic models: from Nokia's S40 and S60 series, to Sony Ericsson, Motorola, Samsung, and many others.",
    "description3": "I hope this project can make it a little easier for people who still love old phones to keep using them — and maybe, keep them alive a little longer."
